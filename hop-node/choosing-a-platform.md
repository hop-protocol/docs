# Choosing a Platform

A bonder can be run on any setup you are comfortable with. The preferred method is to run the bonder locally, but there is nothing stopping you from running it on a virtual private server (VPC) on the Cloud.

To see an example of an EC2 setup, check out the link below.

{% content-ref url="ec2-setup.md" %}
[ec2-setup.md](ec2-setup.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

When you make your choice, continue onto the next section to prepare for the installation of the bonder client.
