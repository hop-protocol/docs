# Monitoring

Here are some ways you can monitor the bonder:

### CloudWatch Logs

You can stream logs to an aggregate logging service like [CloudWatch Logs](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) and filter by log type.

{% content-ref url="docker-cloudwatch-logs.md" %}
[docker-cloudwatch-logs.md](docker-cloudwatch-logs.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Prometheus

You can monitor via [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) and [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana).

{% content-ref url="prometheus-monitoring.md" %}
[prometheus-monitoring.md](prometheus-monitoring.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Other

We're open to more monitoring suggestions by the community!
